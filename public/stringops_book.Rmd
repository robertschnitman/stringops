# Introduction {-#index}

When creating syntax, one has to ask themselves about the naming scheme: should I make the functions short for typing efficiency, or long for increased readability? Ruby has the former benefit, but sometimes the methods can be difficult to remember (e.g. is it `len` or `length`? Is it `swapcase` or `swap_case`?), as there isn't a consistent naming scheme--however, some functions have synonyms to help those from other programming languages learn Ruby faster (e.g. `reduce` and `inject` do the same thing). On the other hand, the `stringr` library has a consisent naming scheme for its functions, but does not have synonyms, so you are forced to learn the `stringr` way. Thirdly, and perhaps tagentially, R does not have concatenation operator (only functions) like in Ruby and BASIC, which is odd, as many situations require concatenation; so using the `paste/paste0()` functions can make code less readable. As such, I am introducing a new package to take these considerations into account: `stringops`, a work-in-progress library consisting of tools for processing strings in R.

What this package brings are (1) a consistent naming-scheme for functions, (2) synonyms for said functions, and (3) a concatenation operator. The first item benefits users of all skill levels, as it makes certain functions easier to remember while making use of RStudio's predictive text. The second item is useful when one tires of typing `string_cull()`, for example, and wishes to use a shorthand to simplify the code (in this case, the shorthand would be `cull()`). The third item's benefit is more readable code by avoiding the function syntax of `paste/paste0()`. Ultimately, these items will hopefully make processing strings in R more fun for the user!

# Installation {-}

This package currently is only available on GitHubâ€“there are no plans to submit this package to CRAN at this time. As such, please use the `devtools` library to install `stringops`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')

devtools::install_github('robertschnitman/stringops')
```

```{r}
library(stringops)
```

# Case Manipulation

The functions in this chapter allow you to modify the case of the string. 

## `string_lower()`

**synonyms: `s_lower()`, `lower()`**

The `string_lower()` function makes all characters in a string vector in their lower case.

```{r}
string_lower('UPPER')
```

```{r}
string_lower(rownames(mtcars))
```


## `string_upper()`

**synonyms: `s_upper()`, `upper()`**

The `string_upper()` function make all characters in a string vector in their capitalized case.

```{r}
string_upper('lower')
```

```{r}
string_upper(rownames(mtcars))
```


## `string_swapcase()`

**synonyms: `s_swapcase()`, `swapcase()`**

The `string_swapcase()` function switches the case for each character in a string vector.

```{r}
string_swapcase('strangeCASING')
```

```{r}
string_swapcase(rownames(mtcars))
```

## `string_titlecase()`

**synonyms: `s_titlecase`, `titlecase()`**

The `string_titlecase()` function converts the first character of each word to uppercase.

```{r}
strings <- c('and then there were none', 'silent hill: revelations', 'the lightning thief')

string_titlecase(strings)
```


# Cut Strings

The functions in this chapter cut off (empty) strings.

## `string_chomp()`

**synonyms: `s_chomp()`, `chomp()`**

Remove all whitespace characters from a string.

```{r}
string_chomp(rownames(mtcars))
```

## `string_chop()`

**synonyms: `s_chop()`, `chop()`**

Remove the last character from a string.

```{r}
string_chop(rownames(mtcars))
```

## `string_cut()`

**synonym: `s_cut()`**

Remove characters from either the left, right, or both ends of a string.

```{r}
string_cut("cut this please", which = 'left')
string_cut("cut this please", which = 'right')
string_cut("cut this please", which = 'both')
```


## `string_trim()`

**synonyms: `s_trim()`, `trim()`**

Remove whitespace characters from a specific direction. Acts the same as `trimws()`, but the source code is more readable.

```{r}
s <- "   s  "

string_trim(s, 'left')
string_trim(s, 'right')
string_trim(s, 'both')
```

### Source code of `trimws()` vs. `string_trim()`

```{r}
trimws
string_trim
```

# Compare Strings

The functions in this chapter compares strings, outputting a Boolean vector.

## `string_isblank()`

**synonyms: `s_isblank()`, `isblank()`, `is.blank()`

The function `string_isblank()` tests whether a vector consists of only blank characters.

```{r}
string_isblank("         ")
string_isblank("    string     ")
```

## `%like%`

The `%like%` operator tests whether a pattern match is found in a string.

```{r}
rownames(mtcars) %like% "^M"
```

# Concatenate Strings

The functions in this chapter allow you to concatenate strings together.

## `%&%` (concatenation operator)

The `%&%` operator acts similar to BASIC's `&`, concatenating two elements together.

```{r}
'a' %&% 'b'
```
```{r}
"Car: " %&% rownames(mtcars)
```

## `string_prefix()`

**synonyms: `s_prefix()`, `prefix()`**

`string_prefix()` appends a string to the beginning of another string.

```{r}
string_prefix(rownames(mtcars), "A ")
```

## `string_suffix()`

**synonyms: `s_suffix()`, `suffix()`**

`string_suffix()` appends a string to the end of another string.

```{r}
string_suffix(rownames(mtcars), " model")
```

# Cull Strings

The functions in this chapter focus on culling (extracting) strings based on patterns and positions.

## `string_cull()`

**synonyms: `s_cull()`, `cull()`, `string_extract()`, `s_extract()`, `extract()`**

The function `string_cull()` culls (or extracts) a pattern from a string vector--if no pattern is found, \code{NA} is returned.

```{r}
# extract beginning "M" from each element.
string_cull(rownames(mtcars), '^M')
```

```{r}
# extract elements in full that begin with "M".
string_cull(rownames(mtcars), "^M.*")
```

## `string_left/right/mid()`

**synonyms: `s_left/right/mid()`, `left/right/mid()`**

The `string_left()`, `string_right()`, and `string_mid()` functions act the same as Excel's `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, and `MID()` functions, respectively.

```{r}
string_left(rownames(mtcars), 3)
string_right(rownames(mtcars), 3)
string_mid(rownames(mtcars), 2, 4)
```

# Find Strings

## `string_find()`

**synonyms: `s_find()`, `find()`**

The function `string_find()` acts similar to `grep(string, x, value = TRUE)`: it subsets a vector to found pattern matches, returning the full element.

```{r}
string_find(rownames(mtcars), '^M')
```

## `string_findi()`

**synonyms: `s_findi()`, `findi()`**

The function `string_findi()` acts similar to `grep(string, x)`: it subsets a vector to found pattern matches, returning the indices.

```{r}
string_findi(rownames(mtcars), '^M')
```

## `string_findl()`

**synonyms: `s_findl()`, `findl()`**

The function `string_findl()` acts similar to `grepl(string, x)`: it returns `TRUE` if a pattern match has been found, `FALSE` otherwise.

```{r}
string_findl(rownames(mtcars), '^M')
```

## `string_findm()`

**synonyms: `s_findm()`, `findm()`**

`string_findm()` functions finds pattern matches and returns `NA` if none are found.

```{r}
string_findm(rownames(mtcars), '^M')
```

## `string_remove()`

**synonyms: `s_remove()`, `remove()`**

`string_remove()` replaces a given string with a blank character.

```{r}
string_remove(rownames(mtcars), "^M")
```


## `string_replace()`

**synonyms: `s_replace()`, `find_replace()`, `fr()`, `search_replace()`, `sr()`**

`string_replace()` is a simplified `gsub()`: it finds a pattern and replaces it with a given string.

```{r}
string_replace(rownames(mtcars), "^M", "Z")
```

# Join Strings

The functions in this chapter joins (collapses) a vector of elements into a single string.

## `string_join()`

**synonyms: `s_join()`, `join()`**

Join (collapse) a vector of elements into a single string.

```{r}
string_join(rownames(mtcars), ", ")
```


# Miscellaneous String Functions

The functions in this chapter do not have common functionalities with the previous chapters: they deal with a myriad of circumstances.

## `string_dup()`

**synonyms: `s_dup()`, `dup()`**

`string_dup()` acts the same as `strrep()`: it repeats a string `n` number of times.

```{r}
string_dup(rownames(mtcars), 3)
```

## `string_insert()`

**synonyms: `s_insert()`, `insert()`**

`string_insert()` inserts a string at a specified position.

```{r}
string_insert("abcd", "Z", 3)
```

## `string_len()`

**synonyms: `s_len()`, `len()`**

`stirng_len()` acts the same as `nchar()`: it counts the number of characters per vector element.

## `string_reverse()`

**synonyms: `s_reverse()`, `reverse()`**

`string_reverse()` reverses the characters in a string.

```{r}
string_reverse(rownames(mtcars))
```

## `string_split()`

**synonym: `s_split()`**

`string_split()` acts the same as `strsplit()`: it splits a string by a specified character.

```{r}
string_split(rownames(mtcars), " ")
```
